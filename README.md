|  Topic  | Application of an Automatic Plagiarism Detection System in a Large-scale Assessment of English Speaking Proficiency |
| --- | --- |
| Aims  | To build an automatic system for detecting plagarized spoken responses for non-native speakers during assesment of English Speaking Proficiency.|
| Previous Work | Most of the previous work are focused on written document where document is compared to a body of reference or document is evaluated independently without referece collection(Alzahrani et al.,2012), Stylometric features(Stein et al.,2011), Stop word-baseed features(Stamatos, 2011), n-gram overlap(Lyon et al.,2006) etc. The detection system is robust even in the presence of word-level modifier between the source and the plagarized text.|
|                 |Little work has been done on spoken responses and most relies on simulated plagarism or artificial plagarized material as it is difficult to collect corpora of actual plagarized material. The authors own previous studies on simulated dataset from an operational large-scale, standarized English proficiency assessment obtained F1-measures of 70.6% ysing an automatic systems |
